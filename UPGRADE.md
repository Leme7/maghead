UPGRADE TO 4.0.x
======================

1. data inflating will only happen when using accessor method.

    $book->is_published; // will return the raw value from database.
    $book->isPublished() // will return Boolean value (true or false)

2. boolean columns will generate `isXXX` accessors.

    "published" => "isPublished()"
    "is_published" => "isPublished()"

3. `BaseModel::load` now returns record object instead of returning a Result object:

    $foundBook = Book::load(321);

4. Replace `create` with `createAndLoad`:

    $author = new Author;
    $author = $author->createAndLoad(array( 'name' => 'Z' , 'email' => 'z@z' , 'identity' => 'z' ));

5. Fix `create` and `find` logics:
  - BaseModel::create now returns Result object directly and don't reload
    created data to the object itself.
  - BaseModel::load now returns the found record instead of load the data 
    to the object itself.

6. `BaseModel::deflate` method is removed.

7. `BaseModel::deflateData` method is removed.

8. `BaseModel::getSchema` method is now static.

9. Remove arguments from beforeDelete and afterDelete (the user may get the data from the data object directly)

10. `createOrUpdate` is now renamed to `updateOrCreate`.

11. `BaseModel::load` is now static method.

12. Trigger methods like `beforeCreate`, `beforeUpdate`, `afterUpdate` are moved to BaseRepo.

13. `lockWrite` => `BaseRepo::writeLock`, `lockRead` => `BaseRepo::readLock`

14. Renamed `BaseRepo::load` to `BaseRepo::loadWith`.

15. `load` is now a generic method for both primary key and conditions in array.

16. Added `BaseRepo::loadByKeys` for load with keys.

17. `BaseModel::loadByPrimaryKey` and `BaseRepo::loadByPrimaryKey` are added.

18. `BaseModel::find` is removed.

19. `BaseCollection::loadQuery` method is now deprecated.

### ConfigLoader

1. LazyRecord\ConfigLoader is now renamed to Maghead\\Runtime\\Config\\FileConfigLoader

1. FileConfigLoader::load -> ConfigLoader::loadFile as a static method and 
    return `Config` object.

2. Simplify `data_source` config by assumming the default node is "master".

        databases:
          master:
            dsn: ...

- Added columnClassAlias to DeclareSchema, so that we can define uuid column by using:

    $this->column('uuid', 'uuid');

- Added DeclareSchema::enableHiddenPrimaryKey option for schemas that don't need primary key column.

- Added BaseRepo::move(BaseRepo $target) method for moving records.
